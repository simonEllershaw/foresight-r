# Ethos-ares config

A key aim is to compare Foresight-R to previous EHR foundation models. To this end this repo's data pre-processing
is copied from [ethos-ares](https://github.com/ipolharvard/ethos-ares/tree/2d54383997318eb52f3d47b5969a66fc166b71ff/scripts/meds/mimic).

This includes
- configs
- pre_MEDS.py
- polars and meds-transforms package versions (see pyproject.toml)
