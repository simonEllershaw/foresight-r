# Natural Language adaptation of the ETHOS_ARES MIMIC-IV event config for Foresight.
# Adapted from: https://github.com/ipolharvard/ethos-ares/blob/2d54383997318eb52f3d47b5969a66fc166b71ff/scripts/meds/mimic/configs/event_configs-ed.yaml
#
# Key modifications for narrative representation:
# - Replaces structured codes with descriptive natural language phrases and semantic connectors.
# - Uses human-readable titles/descriptions (e.g., ICD titles) instead of raw identifiers.
# - Explicitly models units and splits compound events (e.g., Blood Pressure) for clarity.
# - Comments out fields unused in the target tokenization to reduce noise.
